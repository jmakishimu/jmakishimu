- 👋 Hi, I’m @jmakishimu
## 🧠 Who I Am  
I’m Jean-Maxime Larouche — AI researcher, computational neuroscientist (Ph.D. candidate), and entrepreneur. I build bridges between neuroscience, AI, and philosophy to design systems that are intelligent, interpretable, and ethically grounded.

## 🔬 Interests  
- Neuroscience-based AI architectures  
- Symbolic and sub-symbolic integration  
- Responsible and sustainable AI infrastructures  
- Attribution, memory, and consciousness modeling in computational systems  
- High-leverage theory building — from epistemology to implementation

## 🌱 Currently Learning / Building  
- Low-level firmware-to-software optimization for ML inference  
- Scalable cognitive benchmarks and datasets for LLMs  
- Causal representation learning and self-reflexive architectures  
- Topological foundations for consciousness modeling (via the PST framework)

## 🤝 I’m Open to Collaborate On  
- Hybrid AI systems integrating formal reasoning and perception  
- Scientific and ethical foundations of AGI  
- Initiatives compensating human creators in the AI training loop  
- Startups or coalitions aiming to reimagine human-AI co-agency
